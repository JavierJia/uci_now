This is a special  active-learning session on Agile using the Open Space meeting format.  Our goal is both for you to learn something about Agile of interest to  you, as well as to experience Open Space. This is a brief &#39;precursor&#39; of  the main Agile Open Space conference held at UCI for the last several  years. It will take place again at DBH this year and we hope that many  of you will attend the conference in September 2013. <br /> <br />Open Space Technology is one way to enable all kinds of people, in any  kind of organization, to create inspired meetings and events. Over the  last 20+ years, it has also become clear that opening space, as an  intentional leadership practice, can create inspired organizations,  where ordinary people work together to create extraordinary results with  regularity. <br /> <br />Using the Open Space Technology framework, we hold gatherings where  sessions are self-organized around topics important to the participants. <br /> <br />We invite you to take this opportunity to share your experiences, test  new ideas and learn what other practitioners are thinking and doing! <br /> <br />For Friday&#39;s session, please think about what about Agile you find  interesting or challenging or difficult, what it might do well or not  very well, what is missing or should be the next &#39;big idea&#39; for the  future of Agile development. <br /> <br />Bio <br /> <br />Scott, Adam and David are well-established coaches, mentors,  practitioners and teachers of Agile methods in California. They  participate regularly in the conference held at UCI, but it is otherwise  rare to have the benefit of all three in one place for one purpose. <br /> </description>

For instance, technologies                               such as the electronic medical record and                               computerized patient order entry system                               are now considered vital to a hospital&rsquo;s                               success. Although these and other health                               technologies can certainly help in                               addressing many problems that plague                               healthcare, they are often not designed to                               support an important aspect of the work in                               hospitals&rsquo; collaboration.</span></p>                           <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">In this presentation, I will                               discuss a set of studies where I have                               applied methods and concepts from the                               field of Computer Supported Cooperative                               Work (CSCW) to examine the relationship                               between collaboration, HIT, and workflow                               in hospitals. I will argue that in order                               to design HIT that supports collaboration,                               we need to view these technologies from an                               interdisciplinary perspective.

He                               received his Ph.D. in Information and                               Computer Science from UCI in 2003. Dr.                               Reddy&rsquo;s primary research interests are at                               the intersections of Biomedical                               Informatics and Computer Supported                               Cooperative Work (CSCW). He is especially                               interested in the design, implementation                               and adoption of collaborative healthcare                               technologies such as electronic patient                               records. Dr. Reddy&rsquo;s research is focused                               on how these and other health information                               technologies can support collaboration and                               coordination amongst healthcare providers.

In this talk, I present our recent work on mobile computing and privacy in online social networks. Specifically, I will describe (a) how one can go about building a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones and (b) how one can provision fine-grained privacy controls with Twitter. Below, I provide a brief synopsis of the two projects.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">Smartphone Cloud</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">: Every night, a large number of idle smartphones are plugged into a power source for recharging the battery. For a large enterprise which supplies its employees with smartphones, a computing infrastructure that leverages idle smartphones being charged overnight is an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to running tasks on traditional server infrastructure. Building a cloud with smartphones presents a unique set of challenges that stem from heterogeneities in CPU Clock speed, variability in network bandwidth and low availability compared to servers. We address many of these challenges to build a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">Twitsper</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">: User privacy has been an increasingly growing concern in online social networks. While most online social networks today provide some form of privacy controls so that their users can protect their shared content from other users, these controls are typically not sufficiently expressive and/or do not provide fine-grained protection of information. We consider the introduction of a new privacy control---group messaging on Twitter, with users having fine-grained control over who can see their messages. We demonstrate that such a privacy control can be offered to users of Twitter today without having to wait for Twitter to make changes</span><span style="font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"><font size="3"> </font></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">to its system.<span>  </span>We do so by designing and implementing Twitsper, a wrapper around Twitter that enables private group communication among existing Twitter users while preserving Twitter&#39;s commercial interests. Our design preserves the privacy of group information. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our implementation of Twitsper imposes minimal server-side bandwidth requirements and incurs low client-side energy consumption.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt"><font face="Calibri"> </font></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">BIO:</span></strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">Srikanth V.

In this nascent project, she draws on historical examples, and 15 plus years of fieldwork, as she attempts to locate big data in time and space. Playing on the notion of big data as an ethnographic subject, she teases out different kinds of characteristics of big data as secrets, lies, responsibilities, stories, and even as its own agent. In particular, Bell is interested in the ways sense is made of big data, by whom, and in what circumstances; analytics, algorithms, and sense-making are all in her frame.</span></span></p>  <p class="Default"> </p>  <p style="margin-left: 4.5pt" class="MsoNormal"><span class="A2"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: &quot;District Medium&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">BIO </span></span><span class="A6"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Dr. Genevieve Bell is an anthropologist with 15 years of experience driving innovation in the high tech industry.

We are bringing <br />together three instructors who have taught successful MOOCs to share their experiences and ideas. <br />All are welcome. </div><div align="left"><br /><div align="center"><strong><em>Panelists </em></strong><br /> Dan Russell, Google <br />Scott Klemmer, Stanford University Charles Severance, University of Michigan <br /></div></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="center"><strong><em>Moderator </em></strong><br />Gary Olson, UC Irvine </div><div align="left"><br /><div align="center"><strong><em>Panelists&rsquo; Backgrounds </em></strong><br /></div></div><div align="center">Dan Russell is the Google Uber Tech Lead for Search Quality and User Happiness.  He is the creator <br />and moderator of &ldquo;AGoogleADay.com&rdquo; which tests your search skills.  More relevant to this panel, he <br />has developed and delivered two very well received MOOCs:  Basic Power Searching with Google, and <br />Advanced Power Searching with Google.  He has not only delivered these MOOCs several times, but has <br />mountains of data to analyze their success. <br /> <br />Scott Klemmer is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, moving soon to UCSD.  <br />Scott has created and delivered a very popular course on Human Computer Interaction, with the key <br />feature that students evaluate each others&rsquo; work.  This led to the design of a peer assessment <br />system for Coursera that has been used by more than two dozen courses. Scott has additionally done <br />research on online classes, their construction, delivery and analysis. <br /> <br />Charles Severance is Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of <br />Information.  Previously he was the Executive Director of the Sakai Foundation, the core of many <br />learning management systems.  Charles is better known as &ldquo;Dr. Chuck,&rdquo; hosting a national TV show <br />Internet: TCI on TCI Cable.  More recently he has offered a MOOC, &ldquo;Internet History, Technology and <br />Security,&rdquo; one of the first humanities courses run by Coursera, and an early proving ground for <br />peer-&shy;‐grading. <br /> <br />Gary Olson is Donald Bren Professor of Computer and Information Sciences in the school of the same <br />name.  He is an ACM Fellow and a Lifetime Achievement Award winner from ACM:SIGCHI, the special <br />interest group in Computer Human Interaction.  With his background in cognitive psychology and <br />current work in distance work that is enabled by technology, he is both very excited and deeply <br />concerned about the opportunities afforded by MOOCS. <br />Sponsored by The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences <br /></div><br /></description>

<description><p>Leonard J. Schulman</p><p>Caltech</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">TITLE: </span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"><span> </span>Little Data</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">ABSTRACT:</span></strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">A proliferation of sensors and networks has led to the so-called &quot;Big Data&quot; challenge. In a nutshell the challenge is that for all but the simplest of computational problems, processing power cannot keep pace with the increase in data sets sizes currently being generated in <br />commerce, science and government.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">A key approach to this challenge is the construction of &quot;epsilon-approximations&quot; or &quot;core-sets&quot;. These are compressed versions of the data set which faithfully preserve properties of interest. I&#39;ll talk about some work (joint with D. Feldman and M. Langberg) systematically establishing how to do this kind of compression for a range of clustering-type problems. This requires a combination of new concepts (the total sensitivity of a set of functions; bicriteria approximation) with classic notions from the theory of supervised learning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"></span><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">BIO:</span></strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;">Leonard J. Schulman received the B.Sc. in Mathematics in 1988 and the Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 1992, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

This has resulted in significant research and development efforts on 4G multi-channel wireless cellular systems (e.g., LTE and WiMax) that target new ways to achieve higher data rates, lower latencies, and a much better user experience. Further, in these multi-channel systems, such as OFDM, the Transmission Time Interval (TTI), within which the scheduling decisions need to be made, is typically on the order of a few milliseconds. On the other hand, there are hundreds of orthogonal channels that can be allocated to different users. Hence, many decisions have to be made within a short scheduling cycle, which means that it is critical that scheduling policies must have low complexity. Thus, a major challenge in the development of next generation wireless networks is to design scheduling policies that can simultaneously provide high throughput, low delay, and low complexity.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;"> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;">In this talk, I will present a unifying framework for designing low-complexity scheduling policies in the downlink of multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless networks that can provide optimal performance in terms of both throughput and delay. We first develop new easy-to verify sufficient conditions for rate-function delay-optimality in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime, and for throughput-optimality in general (non-asymptotic) settings. The sufficient conditions enable us to prove rate-function delay-optimality for a class of Oldest Packets First (OPF) policies and throughput optimality for a large class of Maximum Weight in the Fluid limit (MWF) policies. While a recently developed scheduling policy is both throughput-optimal and rate-function delay-optimal, it has a very high complexity of O(n<sup>^5</sup>), where n is the number of channels or users, rendering it impractical. By intelligently combining policies from the classes of OPF policies and MWF policies, we design hybrid policies that have a low complexity of O(n^{2.5} log n), and are yet both throughput and rate-function delay optimal. We further develop two simpler greedy policies that are throughput-optimal and have are near delay-optimal. The efficacy of our schemes and comparisons with the state-of-the-art are also illustrated through simulations.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;">Bio:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;">Ness Shroff received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 1994.

Based upon the in-depth investigations of dynamics that  took place in an online community of bankers, an occupation that has  experienced new moral taint during the recent financial crisis, this  research shows how participants relied upon specific affordances of the  online forums in order to deal with the new taint. It then builds a  grounded theory for how members of an occupational online community deal  with new moral taint. We find that participants experience the new taint  as a threat to their professional identity and collective appear to go  through first denying and bargaining with this new taint, but gradually  moving towards acceptance.The theory also highlights unique affordances  of online forums as compared to other settings in which occupational  members usually deal with taint such as work settings, family and  friendship networks, and professional associations. This paper adds to  the literatures on tainted work by showing for the first time how an  occupational community deals with a new (as opposed to existing) taint  as well as to IS literature by elaborating how online communities can be  used by professional groups not only for knowledge sharing, but also for  social support relating to stresses of the occupation as well as how  affordances of an online forum can help occupational members deal with  new taint beyond traditional mechanisms. <br /> <br /><strong class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Bio<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></strong> <br /> <br />Natalia Levina is an Associate Professor at New York University Stern  School of Business.

Young people around the world are thinking, learning, creating, and mobilizing politically in different ways as a consequence of their greater control over the means of cultural production and circulation than previous generations. Drawing on research conducted by the Media, Activism, and Participatory Politics research team at the USC Annenberg School, Jenkins will cite examples of innovative forms of networked politics that tap the affordances of new media platforms and participatory culture practices to recruit and mobilize American youth towards social change. Specifically, he will cite examples from the Occupy Movement, the DREAMers, Invissible Children&rsquo;s Kony 2012, various forms of fan-based activism, and other case studies from his team&rsquo;s research that may help us better understand the ways that acts of remixing and grassroots circulation are enabling alternative ideological perspectives to reach and engage a wider public than would have been imaginable in an era dominated by broadcast media. Ultimately, this talk will seek to explain what I mean by &ldquo;participatory culture&rdquo; and explore what challenges we face in trying to more fully realize this ideal.</p></span></description>

In this talk, I will discuss some of our work to address this problem in two very different areas.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">First, we examine the problem of photorealistic image synthesis, which involves the generation of an image from a scene description. The most powerful methods for this are based on Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, but they are plagued by noise at low sampling rates which makes them impractical for many applications and has limited their use.<span>  </span>We propose a new way to think about the source of Monte Carlo noise and use this understanding to create an image-space filter that removes MC noise but preserves important scene detail.<span>  </span>This enables the generation of photorealistic images in a few minutes that are comparable to those that took hundreds of times longer to render.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">Second, I discuss our recent developments for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. Although the world has high dynamic range illumination (meaning that the darkest and brightest parts of a scene differ in intensity by many orders of magnitude), conventional digital cameras only capture a narrow portion of this range.<span>  </span>A common way to capture HDR images with a conventional camera is to take a set of images at different exposures and then merge them together.<span>  </span>This works well for static scenes, but produces visible ghosting artifacts for scenes with motion.<span>  </span>In the second half of my talk, I present a new way to think about the problem of reconstructing HDR images from a set of inputs based on a new optimization that minimizes what we call the HDR image synthesis equation.<span>  </span>Using this framework, we show that we can produce results superior to previous techniques for HDR imaging.</span><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">BIO:</span></strong></p><p><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">Dr. Pradeep Sen is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<span>  </span>He received his B.S. from Purdue University and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University.<span>  </span>His core research is in the areas of computer graphics, computational image processing, and computer vision.

<description>ISR Research Forum <br />Friday, May 31 <br /><a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/events/Research-Forum-2013/">http://www.isr.uci.edu/events/Research-Forum-2013/</a> <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/events/Research-Forum-2013/keynote.html">http://www.isr.uci.edu/events/Research-Forum-2013/keynote.html</a> <br /> <br />ISR Forum Keynote: <br />&quot;When, Where, and Why Software Systems Decay and What We Can Do About It&quot; <br />Nenad Medvidovic, Professor, Computer Science Dept., University of  Southern California <br /> <br />Location: DBH 6011 <br />Time: 3:00 - 4:00 <br />Refreshments will be served on the 6th floor. <br /> <br />ABSTRACT <br />Engineers frequently neglect to carefully consider the impact of their  changes to a software system. As a result, the software system&#39;s  architectural design eventually deviates from the original designers&#39;  intent and degrades through unplanned introduction of new and/or  invalidation of existing design decisions. Architectural decay increases  the cost of making new modifications and decreases a system&#39;s  reliability, until engineers are no longer able to effectively evolve  the system. At that point, the system&#39;s actual architecture may have to  be recovered from the implementation artifacts, but this is a  time-consuming and error-prone process, and leaves critical issues  unresolved: the problems caused by architectural decay will likely be  obfuscated by the system&#39;s many elements and their interrelationships,  thus risking further decay. In this talk I will focus on pinpointing  locations in a software system&#39;s architecture that reflect architectural  decay. I will discuss the reasons why that decay occurs. Specifically, I  will present an emerging catalog of commonly occurring symptoms of decay  -- architectural &quot;smells&quot;. I will illustrate the occurrence of smells  identified in the process of recovering the architectures of several  real-world systems. Finally, I will provide a comparative analysis of a  number of techniques that aim to recover a system&#39;s architectural design  from the system&#39;s implementation. <br /> <br />ABOUT THE SPEAKER <br />Nenad Medvidovic a Professor and Associate Chair for Ph.D. Affairs in  the Computer Science Department at the University of Southern  California.

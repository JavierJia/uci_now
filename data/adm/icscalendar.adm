The robots physical embodiment is at the heart of SARs effectiveness, as it leverages the inherently human tendency to engage with lifelike (but not necessarily human-like or otherwise biomimetic) social behavior. People readily ascribe intention, personality, and emotion to robots; SAR leverages this engagement stemming from non-contact social interaction involving speech, gesture, movement demonstration and imitation, and encouragement, to develop robots capable of monitoring, motivating, and sustaining user activities and improving human learning, training, performance and health outcomes. Human-robot interaction (HRI) for SAR is a growing multifaceted research area at the intersection of engineering, health sciences, neuroscience, social, and cognitive sciences.   This talk will describe our research into embodiment, modeling and steering social dynamics, and long-term user adaptation for SAR. The research will be grounded in projects involving analysis of multi-modal activity data, modeling personality and engagement, formalizing social use of space and non-verbal communication, and personalizing the interaction with the user over a period of months, among others. The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated by human subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.

Title: Refusing to fail: Over-persistence, under-persistence, and the gender  gap in science  Abstract: Research on gender differences in science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics (STEM) fields typically focuses on the under-representation  of women, attributing gender differences to factors like the chilly  climate in these fields and womens choices to avoid STEM. The present  study extends this literature in two ways. First, we examine where women  who leave STEM fields go, and whether their choices to opt out of STEM  should be conceptualized as under-persistence. Second, we examine  whether men persist excessively in the face of negative feedback in  these same fields. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we find evidence  that men tended to choose mathematics over verbal questions in a testing  environment where the mathematics problems were extremely difficult and  they were paid for performance. Corroborating evidence of this male  over-persistence effect is also found in college STEM course-taking  behavior, where men are more likely to re-take STEM courses after  failing them.  Bio Andrew Penner is currently an assistant professor in the Department of  Sociology at the University of California, Irvine, where he is a member  of the Irvine Network on Interventions in Development. He is also a  faculty affiliate of the Master of Public Policy program, the UC  Educational Evaluation Center, the Center for Demographic and Social  Analysis, and the Center for Organizational Research. His research  examines gender, race, and family inequality in education and the labor  market, and how physical characteristics are translated into social  inequality. He is currently involved in projects examining the role of  marriage and children in creating gender wage inequality in Norway, the  implications of racial fluidity for inequality in the United States, and  the over-representation of men in mathematics and the sciences.

This is a special  active-learning session on Agile using the Open Space meeting format.  Our goal is both for you to learn something about Agile of interest to  you, as well as to experience Open Space. This is a brief 'precursor' of  the main Agile Open Space conference held at UCI for the last several  years. It will take place again at DBH this year and we hope that many  of you will attend the conference in September 2013.  Open Space Technology is one way to enable all kinds of people, in any  kind of organization, to create inspired meetings and events. Over the  last 20+ years, it has also become clear that opening space, as an  intentional leadership practice, can create inspired organizations,  where ordinary people work together to create extraordinary results with  regularity.  Using the Open Space Technology framework, we hold gatherings where  sessions are self-organized around topics important to the participants.  We invite you to take this opportunity to share your experiences, test  new ideas and learn what other practitioners are thinking and doing!  For Friday's session, please think about what about Agile you find  interesting or challenging or difficult, what it might do well or not  very well, what is missing or should be the next 'big idea' for the  future of Agile development.  Bio  Scott, Adam and David are well-established coaches, mentors,  practitioners and teachers of Agile methods in California. They  participate regularly in the conference held at UCI, but it is otherwise  rare to have the benefit of all three in one place for one purpose.  " }

For instance, technologies                               such as the electronic medical record and                               computerized patient order entry system                               are now considered vital to a hospitals                               success.

In this presentation, I will                               discuss a set of studies where I have                               applied methods and concepts from the                               field of Computer Supported Cooperative                               Work (CSCW) to examine the relationship                               between collaboration, HIT, and workflow                               in hospitals. I will argue that in order                               to design HIT that supports collaboration,                               we need to view these technologies from an                               interdisciplinary perspective.

Our work targets several directions in (a) exploiting the smartphone resources in an appropriate way for computing, information dissemination and sharing and storage and (b) making social networks more usable by providing fine grained privacy controls. In this talk, I present our recent work on mobile computing and privacy in online social networks. Specifically, I will describe (a) how one can go about building a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones and (b) how one can provision fine-grained privacy controls with Twitter. Below, I provide a brief synopsis of the two projects. Smartphone Cloud: Every night, a large number of idle smartphones are plugged into a power source for recharging the battery. For a large enterprise which supplies its employees with smartphones, a computing infrastructure that leverages idle smartphones being charged overnight is an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to running tasks on traditional server infrastructure. Building a cloud with smartphones presents a unique set of challenges that stem from heterogeneities in CPU Clock speed, variability in network bandwidth and low availability compared to servers. We address many of these challenges to build a distributed computing infrastructure using smartphones. Twitsper: User privacy has been an increasingly growing concern in online social networks. While most online social networks today provide some form of privacy controls so that their users can protect their shared content from other users, these controls are typically not sufficiently expressive and/or do not provide fine-grained protection of information. We consider the introduction of a new privacy control---group messaging on Twitter, with users having fine-grained control over who can see their messages. We demonstrate that such a privacy control can be offered to users of Twitter today without having to wait for Twitter to make changes to its system.  We do so by designing and implementing Twitsper, a wrapper around Twitter that enables private group communication among existing Twitter users while preserving Twitter's commercial interests. Our design preserves the privacy of group information. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our implementation of Twitsper imposes minimal server-side bandwidth requirements and incurs low client-side energy consumption. BIO:Srikanth V.

ABSTRACT What does big data want? Taking Kevin Kellys question as a starting point, Genevieve Bell subjects the notion and the reality of big data to ethnographic analysis. In this nascent project, she draws on historical examples, and 15 plus years of fieldwork, as she attempts to locate big data in time and space. Playing on the notion of big data as an ethnographic subject, she teases out different kinds of characteristics of big data as secrets, lies, responsibilities, stories, and even as its own agent. In particular, Bell is interested in the ways sense is made of big data, by whom, and in what circumstances; analytics, algorithms, and sense-making are all in her frame.     BIO Dr. Genevieve Bell is an anthropologist with 15 years of experience driving innovation in the high tech industry. As the Director of Interaction and Experience Research in Intel Labs, Bell leads a team of social scientists, interaction designers, human factors engineers and computer scientists. This organization researches new computing experiences that are centered around peoples needs and desires. In 2010, Bell was named one of Fast Companys inaugural 100 Most Creative People in Business. In 2012 she was inducted into the Women In Technology International (WITI) hall of fame, and she was honored by the Anita Borg Institute as the 2013 Woman of Vision for Leadership.

In a nutshell the challenge is that for all but the simplest of computational problems, processing power cannot keep pace with the increase in data sets sizes currently being generated in commerce, science and government. A key approach to this challenge is the construction of epsilon-approximations or core-sets. These are compressed versions of the data set which faithfully preserve properties of interest. I'll talk about some work (joint with D. Feldman and M. Langberg) systematically establishing how to do this kind of compression for a range of clustering-type problems. This requires a combination of new concepts (the total sensitivity of a set of functions; bicriteria approximation) with classic notions from the theory of supervised learning. BIO:Leonard J.

Simpson cmsimpso@ics.uci.edu","location":"Donald Bren Hall 6011 ","description":"Ness Shroff, Ohio State University Title: Low-Complexity Scheduling Policies for Achieving Throughput and Delay Optimality in Multi-channel (OFDM) Downlink SystemsAbstract:The dramatic increases in demands from multimedia applications have put an enormous strain on the current cellular system infrastructure. This has resulted in significant research and development efforts on 4G multi-channel wireless cellular systems (e.g., LTE and WiMax) that target new ways to achieve higher data rates, lower latencies, and a much better user experience. Further, in these multi-channel systems, such as OFDM, the Transmission Time Interval (TTI), within which the scheduling decisions need to be made, is typically on the order of a few milliseconds. On the other hand, there are hundreds of orthogonal channels that can be allocated to different users. Hence, many decisions have to be made within a short scheduling cycle, which means that it is critical that scheduling policies must have low complexity. Thus, a major challenge in the development of next generation wireless networks is to design scheduling policies that can simultaneously provide high throughput, low delay, and low complexity. In this talk, I will present a unifying framework for designing low-complexity scheduling policies in the downlink of multi-channel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless networks that can provide optimal performance in terms of both throughput and delay. We first develop new easy-to verify sufficient conditions for rate-function delay-optimality in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime, and for throughput-optimality in general (non-asymptotic) settings. The sufficient conditions enable us to prove rate-function delay-optimality for a class of Oldest Packets First (OPF) policies and throughput optimality for a large class of Maximum Weight in the Fluid limit (MWF) policies. While a recently developed scheduling policy is both throughput-optimal and rate-function delay-optimal, it has a very high complexity of O(n^5), where n is the number of channels or users, rendering it impractical. By intelligently combining policies from the classes of OPF policies and MWF policies, we design hybrid policies that have a low complexity of O(n^{2.5} log n), and are yet both throughput and rate-function delay optimal. We further develop two simpler greedy policies that are throughput-optimal and have are near delay-optimal. The efficacy of our schemes and comparisons with the state-of-the-art are also illustrated through simulations.Bio:Ness Shroff received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 1994.

Title:Dealing with newly tainted work in an occupational online  community: A story of bankers dealing with new moral taint following the  financial crisis of 2008 Written by:  Natalia Levina, Stern School of Business - NYU, and  Emmanuelle Vaast, Desautels Faculty of Management - McGill University  *Abstract*  Natalia will discuss her paper, coauthored with Emmanuelle Vaast, which  investigates how members of an occupational online community deal with  new moral taint. Based upon the in-depth investigations of dynamics that  took place in an online community of bankers, an occupation that has  experienced new moral taint during the recent financial crisis, this  research shows how participants relied upon specific affordances of the  online forums in order to deal with the new taint. It then builds a  grounded theory for how members of an occupational online community deal  with new moral taint. We find that participants experience the new taint  as a threat to their professional identity and collective appear to go  through first denying and bargaining with this new taint, but gradually  moving towards acceptance.The theory also highlights unique affordances  of online forums as compared to other settings in which occupational  members usually deal with taint such as work settings, family and  friendship networks, and professional associations. This paper adds to  the literatures on tainted work by showing for the first time how an  occupational community deals with a new (as opposed to existing) taint  as well as to IS literature by elaborating how online communities can be  used by professional groups not only for knowledge sharing, but also for  social support relating to stresses of the occupation as well as how  affordances of an online forum can help occupational members deal with  new taint beyond traditional mechanisms.  *Bio*  Natalia Levina is an Associate Professor at New York University Stern  School of Business.

In this talk, I will discuss some of our work to address this problem in two very different areas. First, we examine the problem of photorealistic image synthesis, which involves the generation of an image from a scene description. The most powerful methods for this are based on Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, but they are plagued by noise at low sampling rates which makes them impractical for many applications and has limited their use.  We propose a new way to think about the source of Monte Carlo noise and use this understanding to create an image-space filter that removes MC noise but preserves important scene detail.  This enables the generation of photorealistic images in a few minutes that are comparable to those that took hundreds of times longer to render. Second, I discuss our recent developments for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. Although the world has high dynamic range illumination (meaning that the darkest and brightest parts of a scene differ in intensity by many orders of magnitude), conventional digital cameras only capture a narrow portion of this range.  A common way to capture HDR images with a conventional camera is to take a set of images at different exposures and then merge them together.  This works well for static scenes, but produces visible ghosting artifacts for scenes with motion.  In the second half of my talk, I present a new way to think about the problem of reconstructing HDR images from a set of inputs based on a new optimization that minimizes what we call the HDR image synthesis equation.  Using this framework, we show that we can produce results superior to previous techniques for HDR imaging.

ABSTRACT Engineers frequently neglect to carefully consider the impact of their  changes to a software system. As a result, the software system's  architectural design eventually deviates from the original designers'  intent and degrades through unplanned introduction of new and/or  invalidation of existing design decisions. Architectural decay increases  the cost of making new modifications and decreases a system's  reliability, until engineers are no longer able to effectively evolve  the system. At that point, the system's actual architecture may have to  be recovered from the implementation artifacts, but this is a  time-consuming and error-prone process, and leaves critical issues  unresolved: the problems caused by architectural decay will likely be  obfuscated by the system's many elements and their interrelationships,  thus risking further decay. In this talk I will focus on pinpointing  locations in a software system's architecture that reflect architectural  decay. I will discuss the reasons why that decay occurs. Specifically, I  will present an emerging catalog of commonly occurring symptoms of decay  -- architectural smells. I will illustrate the occurrence of smells  identified in the process of recovering the architectures of several  real-world systems. Finally, I will provide a comparative analysis of a  number of techniques that aim to recover a system's architectural design  from the system's implementation.
